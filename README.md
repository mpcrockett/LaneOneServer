# Lane One Running - Server

This server was developed based off of an earlier project, E-CommerceServer. Lane One Running provides a RESTful API to provide product data, user session cookies and authentication, and order capabilities to the client. It uses Passport for authentication with Google and provides its own user registration routes as part of the API. It is built with Express, connects to a postgreSQL database, and uses custom Models in its MVC architecture. node-pg-migrate provides database migration capability.
